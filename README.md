# NOTE
~~This component is no longer working, since varnatraffic.com website stopped its info support for the public transport for city of Varna due to disinterest on the part of the municipality. Ð¢he municipality has developed their own api and website which are underdeveloped - lacking even half the information and functions of varnatraffic.com. Until municipality API don't get updated 
to give proper, full and exact information I don't see any point of upgrading the component to use their API.~~

~~The code of the component will stay at GitHub for future reference and eventualy may be updated to work again.~~


Apparently municipality of Varna sign a contract with varnatraffic.com and now services have been restored. How long this will last, nobody can tell, but for now this component is working again!

# VPT
Varna Public Transport custom component for Home Assistant

This custom component holds data for city of Varna, Bulgaria public transport card. 
The information for bus stop is scraped from https://varnatraffic.com website 

You can find the card at [https://github.com/Serios/VPT-Card](https://github.com/Serios/VPT-Card).

### Installation
Download the files from custom_components/varna_public_transport into your 
$homeassistant_config_dir/custom_components/varna_public_transport

Once downloaded and configured as per below information you'll need to restart HomeAssistant to have the custom component and the sensors platform loaded.

### Configuration

Define the sensor in your yaml file with the following configuration parameters:

| Name | Type |         | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| platform | string | **required** | `varna_public_transport` |  |
| stopId | string | **required** |  | This is the bus stop id. See [How to get bus stop id](#getting-bus-stop-id) |
| stopName | string | optional |  | What is the name of the stop. This will be shown as card title |
| show_mode | string | optional | all | What data to be scraped/shown in the card. See [Showing information](#showing-different-types-of-information) |
| max_schedule | int | optional | 10 | Numer of shedules times to be returned. Used in Schedules information. See [Showing information](#showing-different-types-of-information) |
| interval | int | optional | 30 | How offten the sensor shoud scrape for data (in seconds). Note: It is not advisible to set value bellow 10 |
| monitored_lines | list | optional |  | Which lines, comming trough the bus stop, you want to track. See [Showing information](#showing-different-types-of-information) |

Example of basic config

```yaml
- platform: varna_public_transport
  stopId: '553'
  stopName: 'Historical Museum'
```

### Showing different types of information
By defalut the sensor will return all data scraped for the bus stop. This include:
* live data - lines comming to the bus stop at this moment provided by vehicle tracker device. See bellow what kind of information this data contains.
* schedules - Schedule times for diffrent lines comming to the stop. See bellow what kind of information this data contains.

By setting `show_mode` property you can control what data is scraped/returned. Available options are:

`all` - returns both live data and schedules

`live` - returns only live data 

`schedule` - returns only schedule times

#### Live data
This contains:

Vehicle type - Bus or Trolley 

Line number 

Next schedule time - at which the vehicle should be on the stop

Vehicle delay - from the schedule time at which ariving to the stop

Vehicle extras - like airconditioning, wheelcheer access, etc.

Minutes left = before vehicle arrival at the stop based on the delay from schedule,

Distance of the vehicle - distance left to the bus stop.



Showing live data will use `interval` option to scrape https://varnatraffic.com website each N seconds for data

#### Schedule times
This contains:

Line number 

Next schedule times - The times (ahead from last scrape) at which the vehicles on this lines should be on the stop.



Showing `schedule` only don't use `interval` option. Instead the data is scraped on predefined time intervals based on `max_schedule` option value. Thus reducing request to https://varnatraffic.com website to only a couple of times a day

#### Limiting the number of lines for wich information is returned (both Live and Schedule)
By default the sensor will return data for all the lines that are comming to the bus stop. If you don't want that, and need only data for some lines, to be returned, you can specify the line numbers.
The syntax is simple:

```yaml
  monitored_lines:
    - 41
    - 148
```
Important!!!
There are some special line numbers for which https://varnatraffic.com website assign diffrent number than the actual one shown on the bus and use some internal logic to track and show data. Bellow you will find the list with the line number and the actual line number you need to set, if you want to track this line.

| Line number (shown on the bus) | Internal number (which you must set) |
|----|------|
| 17a | 117 |
| 18a | 1018 |
| 31a | 131 |
| 118a | 1118 |
| 209b | 219 |


#### Limiting the number of schedule times
Returning all times on which the vehicle should be on the stop trough the day is nonsence. This will overflow the sensor/card with data, thus by default this is set to 10 results. You can increase/decrease this value by your likings.


### Getting bus stop id
To get the bus stop ID you need to go to https://varnatraffic.com and find your desired bus stop by clicking on the map or by typing it's name in the search box. After that the page will reload with the following url: https://varnatraffic.com/Station/Index/`StopId` where StopId will be some number for example https://varnatraffic.com/Station/Index/762
This is the ID of the desired bus stop


### Some config examples

Basic config:
```yaml
- platform: varna_public_transport
